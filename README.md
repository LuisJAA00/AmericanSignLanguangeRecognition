# AmericanSignLanguangeRecognition

This repository contains the project of computer vision.

The project consist on training 2 neural networks to recognise the american sign language on live video and test which is the best option. The yolov5 model as well as the Rcnn were used as they worked fine on a no dedicated GPU computer (both runned on cpu) and the python code for trainig of each neural network is found on this repository ("YoloTraining.pdf" for yolo, "RcnnModelTrain_mobilenet.pdf" for Rcnn). Results are shown on "poster2.pdf" and the test code can be found on "RealTimeTest.pdf".
